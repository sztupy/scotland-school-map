Downloaded from the government's website https://statistics.gov.scot/data/breadth-and-depth (click "CSV" near "Entire dataset" at the bottom):

Downloaded from the SIMD.scot website (click "Download all data & geographies):
* simd2020_withinds.csv
* simd2020.geojson (converted from SHP)

Note: the above geojson is huge when converted as-is, so the following simplifications have been done using the TopoJSON tools (https://github.com/topojson/topojson):

```
geo2topo simd.geojson > simd.topojson
toposimplify -P 0.05 simd.topojson >! simd-simplified.topojson
```
