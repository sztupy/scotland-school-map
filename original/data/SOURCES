* primary_attainment.csv
* primary_attendance.csv
* primary_population.csv
* secondary_attainment.csv
* secondary_attendance.csv
* secondary_population.csv

Downloaded from the government's website https://statistics.gov.scot/data/breadth-and-depth (click "CSV" near "Entire dataset" at the bottom):
* secondary_datacube.csv

Downloaded from the SIMD.scot website (click "Download all data & geographies):
* simd2020_withinds.csv
* simd2020.geojson (converted from SHP)

Note: the above geojson is huge when converted as-is, so the following simplifications have been done using Qgis:

* First use GRASS `v.generalize` with the `distance_weighting` smoothing algorithm
* Then on the results use GRASS `v.generalize` with the `lang` simplification algorithm with `treshold` set to `5`
* Finally convert the result to GeoJSON using setting `COORDINATE_PRECISION` set to `5`
