Map of schotland's school performance
=====================================

This is a project to show some metrics about primary and secondary schools in Scotland

Primary school data
-------------------

Data is from https://datamap-scotland.co.uk/2022/02/primary-school-ranks-scotland/ It shows the percentage of pupils achieving the required standard across the four measures - Reading, Writing, Numeracy, Listening & Talking. This is based on an average of the P1, P4 and P7 pupils, instead of just taking the P7 one.

The display for Primary Schools can be filtered on the layers selection box in the top right corner, to limit display to schools that are in a particular band, e.g. 90-100%

Secondary school data
---------------------

Data is from two sources:

* Catchment areas and other geographic school information were obtained from https://datamap-scotland.co.uk/2022/07/secondary-school-survey-scotland-2022/
* Results are from the government's statistic website https://statistics.gov.scot/resource?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fstatistics.gov.scot%2Fdata%2Fbreadth-and-depth

By default the map displays colours based on the percentage of pupils achieving at least 5 Highers in the 2020-2021 school year. This can be changed on the left hand side to:

* Percentage of pupils with 4 or more Highers
* Percentage of pupils with 5 or more Highers
* Percentage of pupils with 1 or more Advanced Highers
* Percentage of pupils with 2 or more Advanced Highers
* Percentage of pupils with either 5 or more Highers or 1 or more Advanced Highers (whichever is larger)
* The average between pupils with 5 or more Highers and 1 or more Advanced Highers

The year where the data is taken can also be changed. It can also be aggregated across multiple years.

There is still the option as well to limit display of schools that are in a particular band, e.g. 50-60%, etc.
